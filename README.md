- It is a document database, it stores data in flexibla JSON-like documents
- It is open sourced, meaning its available for free and everyone can use it
- Using the sharding method we can distribute data accross multiple machines, this is particularly helpfull when there are large data sets
- With a schemaless database, 90% of the time adjustments to the database become transparent and automatic.


## What are NoSQL databases? 
- NoSQL injection is a security weakness in a web application that uses a NoSQL database. NoSQL (Not Only SQL) refers to database systems that use more flexible data formats and do not support Structured Query Language (SQL). They typically store and manage data as key-value pairs, documents, or data graphs.


## How do they differ from SQL?

- NOSQL has more relaxed restrictions than SQL, making it easier for hackers to attack NOSQL 
- SQL injection executes in the database engine
- NoSQL attack may execute at the database or application layer depending on the data model and NoSQL API

## What is it’s history?

- MongoDB was founded in 2007 by Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz and Kevin Ryan – the team behind DoubleClick.

- At the Internet advertising company DoubleClick (now owned by Google), the team developed and used many custom data stores to work around the shortcomings of existing databases. The business served 400,000 ads per second, but often struggled with both scalability and agility. Frustrated, the team was inspired to create a database that tackled the challenges it faced at DoubleClick.
